title: "Sandbox vs Live Mode"
description: "UPITranzact provides two environments for API usage: Sandbox for testing and Live for production."
---

## UAT Mode

Use the **UAT environment** to test your integration and simulate payment flows with **dummy data**.

- **Base URL:**

  ```
  https://uat-api.upitranzact.com
  ```
- No real money is transferred.
- Ideal for development, testing, and debugging.

## Live Mode

Use the **live environment** for **real transactions** once your integration is ready for production.

- **Base URL:**

  ```
  https://api.upitranzact.com
  ```
- Real payments are processed through this endpoint.

## Important Note

> Make sure to **switch from sandbox to live mode** in your base URL and credentials **before going live**.
